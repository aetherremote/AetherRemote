# What is Aether Remote
Aether Remote is a plugin that allows you to control the speech and emotes of other players using the plugin. If Glamourer and Mare Synchronos are installed, this expands to include their other player's customization and equipment. The intended audience of this plugin is anyone interested in possession, hypnosis, body swaps, transformations, and mind control.

# Safety & Security
> ❗ You should only use this plugin with those you trust

If you have gotten this far, it is no secret that this plugin interacts in a very invasive, and automated way. I have taken many measures to ensure it is as safe as possible to use.

### 🔑 HTTPS
The connection to the server is encrypted just as any other modern website is.

### 📖 Open Source
All of the code is uploaded on to github here. You can build and compile your own, or verify anything you like about the behavior of the client or server. I believe that this is one of the most important steps to earning trust with this tool.

### ⚙️ Permissions
Users can set permissions controlling exactly what another user can and can't do. These permissions are validated both server side, and client side to ensure no tampering can be done.

### 🛡️ Safe Word
Functionality found in the settings tab to immediately disable the plugin and refuse any further or pending actions.

### ✅ Validation
All actions sent to the server and receieved by the client are validated for correctness. This means, like permissions, both the server and the client will ensure no tampering has occurred. The plugin will not act on invalid data, examples include trying to utilize a command instead of an emote such as `/logout` or `/trade`, or sending invalid message data to the server.

# About The Plugin
Aether Remote is a project I have been working on for a little under a year now. I took inspiration from many sources in the XIV community involving these fetishes. It started as a tool just control speech and emotes but slowly grew as new ideas popped into my mind. I hope that it can be fun for everyone who decides to use it, and I really wish to improve the tool any way I can! Feel free to take a look through any of the code, I've documented the best I can, and hope that they may be of help to anyone seeking to do something similar.
